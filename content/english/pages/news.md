Codenight is a thriving Telegram supergroup community consisting of over five thousand active members, bringing together Ethiopian developers from around the world. As a member of this community, I often find it challenging to catch up and seamlessly follow conversations, especially when I've been inactive for a few days. The accumulation of hundreds of messages can make me feel overwhelmed and lost. This frustrating experience motivated me to seek a solution.

I envisioned a platform that would make it easy to trace back to the original message and navigate through replies in a visually structured and organized manner, free from unrelated chats interrupting the flow. Inspired by Twitter (X), I embarked on building a similar disscussion forum specifically tailored to enhance engagement and communication within our Codenight community.

So, what can you expect from this new platform?

- **Clear Context**: With this platform, you'll instantly grasp how a conversation started and effortlessly navigate through relevant replies. Visual representation of message threads ensures that you never miss a beat.
- **Data Control**: To address the critical challenge of building our own language models, we should encourage the use of our own language when discussing topics. By keeping the data within our own hands, The platform lays the foundation for training our own Language Models in the future. This is an essential step, as there is currently a lack of structured data available for model training. 
Stay tuned for updates on the progress as I work on towards emproving the platform ðŸ˜‰.
