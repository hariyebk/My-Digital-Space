#### Projects related to my personal pain points

<br>
<br>

##### Freelance Ethiopia Clone

<br>

<p style = "word-break: break-all;">
This project aims to create a clone of <a href="https://www.freelanceethiopia.com/"> Freelance Ethiopia's web </a> app with additional features and improvements to enhance the user experience. As a frequent user of their platform for finding jobs, I often encountered various inconveniences related to both the UI and functionality. Instead of simply complaining about these issues or wishing for certain features, I challenged myself to tackle them head-on and find solutions. Through this project, I have successfully addressed the following issues:

</p>



<!-- ![project demo](https://utfs.io/f/0971462c-ec8d-4819-b767-90d2e27abe96-27kpi9.png) -->

<br>

##### Problems I encountered

<br>

1. **Inconvenient Login Process**: 

<p style = "word-break: break-all;"> I found it annoying to repeatedly provide login credentials whenever I left the platform temporarily. It would be more user-friendly to have a persistent user session that remembers me and maintains the session upon returning. </p>

2. **Lack of Job Application Tracking**: 

<p style = "word-break: break-all;"> I faced difficulties in keeping track of the jobs I had applied for. It would be beneficial to have a simple and easy to navigate space where users can easily monitor and manage their job applications, including the ability to view application statuses and relevant details. </p>

3. **No Feedback on Rejected Applications**: 

<p style = "word-break: break-all;"> When my job applications were rejected, I received no feedback, making it challenging to understand why my applications were unsuccessful. It would greatly enhance the user experience to provide more detailed and specific feedback on rejected applications, helping users identify areas for improvement. </p>

4. **Complex Job Filtering**: 

<p style = "word-break: break-all;"> The existing job filtering system allowed users to select multiple sectors simultaneously, but this often made it challenging to query the database effectively. To simplify the filtering process and improve database query efficiency, it would be helpful to implement a more intuitive filtering where only one sector can only be checked at a time. </p>

5. **Lack of Personalized Job Search**: 

<p style = "word-break: break-all;"> The platform did not offer a user preferences section where individuals could customize their job search experience. Having the ability to save preferences, such as preferred job categories, locations, or other criteria, would allow users to tailor their job search and receive more relevant posts instead of being bombarded with irrelevant job posts. </p>

6. **No Option to Update Password**: 

<p style = "word-break: break-all;"> The platform did not offer a way for users to update their passwords. This lack of functionality made it inconvenient for users who wanted to change their passwords for security reasons or update it periodically. Providing a password update feature would enhance the overall user experience and security of the platform. </p>

<!-- ##### Challenges Faced

<br>

During the development of this project, I encountered the following challenges:

1. **N + 1 Problem when Fetching User Application Data**: When fetching user application data for a specific job post, I faced the N + 1 problem, where the application data had to be fetched for each individual user separately, resulting in unnecessary database queries and decreased performance. I had to implement a Global state mechanism to address the N + 1 problem and improve the efficiency of fetching user application data.

2. **Designing a New UI for User Profile**: Redesigning the user profile UI, especially for updating user information, posed a challenge in terms of creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. I had to think creatively and consider various design alternatives to develop an intuitive and responsive UI for the user profile section.

3. **Creating Reusable React Components**: I aimed to make my React components as reusable as possible to enhance code maintainability and reduce redundancy. However, achieving a high level of reusability while accommodating different use cases required careful consideration of component structure and props. I continuously worked on refining my component architecture to strike a balance between reusability and specificity.

4. **Performance-Related Issues**: As my code base grew in complexity, I encountered performance-related issues, such as slow rendering times and suboptimal code execution. I had to analyze and Memoize critical components of the code, including implementing efficient hooks, and optimizing database queries to improve the overall performance of the platform.

<br>

##### What I have gained

<br>

1. **Enhanced Technical and Problem-Solving Skills**: Through the process of successfully completing this project, I have significantly strengthened my technical skills, including proficiency in TypeScript, React 18, Tailwind CSS, and Superbase. Additionally, I have honed my problem-solving abilities by overcoming challenges and finding effective solutions.

2. **Motivation to Address other Real-World Problems**: This project has served as a catalyst for my motivation to explore and address other real-world problems.

3. **Increased Confidence**: Successfully completing a complex project like this has boosted my confidence as a developer. The knowledge and experience gained throughout the project have validated my skills and abilities, providing me with the confidence to take on more ambitious projects in the future. -->

##### Arada dictionary

<br>

<p style = "word-break: break-all;">
Introducing Arada Dictionary: your new spot to understand slang and informal talk! Ever felt lost in conversations because of unfamiliar words? I've been there too. That's why I decided to create Arada Dictionary. I couldn't find any reliable online resources for Amharic slang words and phrases, so I built one using Nextjs 14. </p>

<p style = "word-break: break-all;">
Arada Dictionary isn't just about defining words. It's a place where everyone can help each other understand slang language. Think of it as a community-driven project where we all pitch in to keep up with the latest lingo. </p>

<p style = "word-break: break-all;"> Imagine this: you're traveling to a new city, let's say Dire Dawa and suddenly, people are using words and phrases you've never heard before. It can feel isolating, right? That's where Arada Dictionary comes in. It's like having a local guide to the slang and informal language of different cities, helping you feel more connected no matter where you go. </p>

<br>

##### Challenges Faced

<br>

During the development of this Nextjs project, I faced several challenges:
<br>

1. **Database Service Reliability** : 

<p style = "word-break: break-all;">
Finding a reliable, free cloud PostgreSQL database service was difficult due to limitations such as frequent sleep cycles. This resulted in the need to restart my database connection repeatedly during development. </p>


2. **keeping balance between caching and up-to date data**: 

<p style = "word-break: break-all;"> Striking a balance between caching data for improved performance and avoiding stale data required me to think carefully. I used the revalidatePath function on my server actions only at the points where data can be mutated.  </p>

3. **Security Oversight** : 

<p style = "word-break: break-all;"> I recently made a mistake where I accidentally exposed sensitive database information due to client-side data fetching. I fully acknowledge that this was a significant security oversight for me. It prompted me to shift fetching data on server components securely and passing it to the client-side as props. ensuring that sensitive information remains protected. </p>

4. **Email Service Limitations**: 

<p style = "word-break: break-all;"> The email service provider I used requires custom domain to send emials for different addresses. since I have no custom domain, it restricted the functionality to send emails to only one address (harunbekri6@gmail.com). </p>
